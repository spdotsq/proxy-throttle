= How to throttle?

* time based throttling: 15 API calls in our hour
* interval based throttling: 15 API calls in 40 seconds
* # intelligent throttling
* # be nice throttling
* # entire set throttling (?)

= Sets theory:

A set of clients: we can uniquely identify each client (you specify the identifier or we select it's IP).
A set of API methods: on a macro level this set does not exist

Storage options: memcache or Tokyo Cabinet.

# Cron based time and date.

throttle <rule name>:
  time: 
  duration: one hour
  limit: 100
  client:
    identifier: <request.IP>
    
throttle <rule name>:
  from: 
  to: 
  volume: 
  duration: one hour
