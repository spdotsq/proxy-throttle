h1. About

A proxy to throttle API calls. This is a work in progress, it should not be run in production.

h1. How to throttle?

* time based throttling: 15 API calls in our hour
* interval based throttling: 15 API calls in 40 seconds
* # intelligent throttling
* # be nice throttling
* # entire set throttling (?)

h1. Throttling controls:

* By clients: we can uniquely identify each client (you specify the identifier or we use the IP).
* By API methods

h1. Config sample

<pre>throttle <rule name>:
  time: 
  duration: one hour
  limit: 100
  client:
    identifier: <request.IP>
    
throttle <rule name>:
  from: 
  to: 
  volume: 
  duration: one hour
